################################################################################

Son of WeBWorK - TODO list

DONE	write template file from what we drew on the board
DONE	normalize files:
		- (c) header on all files
		- standard order of preamble lines:
			1. (c) header
			
			2. package PACKAGENAME;
			
			3. short summary of the package (pod's NAME section)
			
			4. use - pragmatic modules
			5. use - standard perl modules
			6. use - CPAN modules
			7. use - webwork modules
		- ALWAYS use strict and use warnings
		- use "use base" rather than "our @ISA"
		- no warnings or errors!
		- (later on) POD documentation for all files
DONE	fix templating code in ContentGenerator, add new escape functions
DONE	implement the new template
DONE	finish ProblemSets and ProblemSet
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE	New interface to PG.pm
	DONE	- instead of it accessing the database directly, accept $user,
		  $set, and $problem as arguments (instead of $setName, etc.)
	DONE	- UPDATE PG.pm'S DOCS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	DONE	- Fix Problem.pm and Hardcopy.pm to work with the new interface
	
	Hardcopy generation
	DONE	- ad-hoc version of &latex2png in Hardcopy.pm (move later)
	DONE	- fix code (heh heh)
	DONE	- fix hardcopySetHeader
	
	Integration of dvipng method of image generation
	N/A	- choice between writing to a temporary TeX file from within
		  dangerousMacros, or queueing the equations up in RAM and
		  passing them out to the caller (via PG_flags?) who will then
		  call &latex2png
	DONE	- write tempfile from dangerousMacros
			- PRO: gets it out of RAM
			- PRO: no dependancies between equations
			- CON: have to coordinate between latex2png and
			       dangerous macros for tempfile locations
	FORGET	- queue equations in RAM
			- PRO: all file access and external calls happen
			       outside of the safe compartment.
			- PRO: latex2png gets to decide where to put files
			- CON: stuff sits in RAM
			- CON: uses a package array to queue equations :p

DONE	display of screen set header in ProblemSet.pm (easy)
DONE	add <!--#if can="blah" warning="1" error="1"-->
DONE	fix alignment of displaymath images
DONE	print $pg->{header_text} in head of Problem.pm
DONE	remove "set" and "prob" from URL generation, remove s/^(set|prob)//;
DONE	remove webwork-dvipng-xxxxx temp directories when finished with them
DONE	make "enter" on the problem form trigger "submit answer", not "redisplay"
DONE	handling of PG warnings (?!?!?!?!)
DONE	time logging
DONE	test transaction logging
DONE	make static images work
DONE	make GD-generated images work
DONE	make HTML links work
DONE	make images in PDFs work
DONE	remove dependancies on Global:: from send_mail_to
DONE	preview button in Problem
DONE	handle PG errors (and warnings) in Hardcopy
DONE	have logout button invalidate key
DONE	Options - email address and password

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>> FOR JANUARY PREVIEW RELEASE <<<<<

DONE	Feedback - need nice modular way of sending email
DONE		customize reciever, make object dumps prettier, link to context
DONE	Professor - redirect to the old system
	pretty die messages (from outside of the translator)
DONE	make sure students can't look at not-yet-open problem sets
DONE	make answer previews use $displayMode
DONE	make preview-on-submit optional
	Increase border size on images by a couple pixels
DONE	effectiveUser for at least Problem.pm
DONE	add a "check answers" button if the user has the apropriate permissions
DONE	write a template escape for printing $user, $effectiveUser, &c. nicely 
	calling logout requires valid key -- doesn't make sense.
DONE	hardcopy - allow hardcopy with correct answers (BRANCH)
DONE	sort problems by due date
DONE	disable "show hint/solution" when there's no hint/solution
DONE	results table
DONE		part(or blank)/entered/preview/result/messages
DONE		don't show messages unless there are some
DONE	make displayMode sticky (for nav and siblings)
DONE	check TTH mode character encodings on mac
	grep for "***" in source, address all issues (hah!)

mike wants:
	problem credit indicator (graphical?)
DONE	answers/solutions in hardcopy
DONE	turn off verbose debugging in feedback mail
DONE	URL on feedback from any module
	email address change notification by email
arnie wants:
	parse errors in student answers hilited more strongly

>>>>> FOR SPRING RELEASE <<<<<

	write TeXImage module to take care of TeX image caching and generation
	replace direct access of $permissionLevel with calls to Authz
	replace hardcoded URL construction with some other method
		(unify dispatcher URL parsing and module URL generation)
	implement professor pages
		have the prof modules be subclasses of the single Professor
		ContentGenerator module? more structured? less structured?
		THIS WILL TAKE LONGER THAN I THINK IT WILL
	implement better (and more unified) file editor

>>>>> AFTER SPRING RELEASE <<<<<

	MySQL and PostgreSQL database backend
	problem library work (?)
	PG language work (?)
	renderer/frontend/database uncoupling (?)

change notes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IO functions (dependancies on other IO functions are not listed)

all variables in the global namespace should be replaced with items in the
%envir hash. all functions that access the envir hash need to be evaluated
from within the safe compartment (i.e. &unrestricted_eval'd).

includePGtext
	$envir{probFileName}
send_mail_to
	$REMOTE_HOST
	$REMOTE_ADDR
	#$Global::smtpServer
	#$Global::webmaster
	(&Global::wwerror)
read_whole_problem_file
read_whole_file
convertPath				stub
getDirDelim				stub
getCourseTempDirectory
	$envir{tempDirectory}
surePathToTmpFile
	#$Global::tmp_directory_permission
	#$Global::numericalGroupID
	(&Global::wwerror)
fileFromPath
directoryFromPath
createFile
createDirectory
getImageDimmensions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Calling LaTeX/dvipng and PDFLaTeX in a nice way
		- create LaTeX.pm (?)
		- &latex2pdf
			- create secure tempdir
			- write hardcopy to tex file
			- call pdflatex
			- move resulting pdf file to tmp/hardcopy/whatever.pdf
			- remove tempdir
		- &latex2png (dvipng method)
			- create secure tempdir
			- write equations to tex file
			- call latex
			- run dvipng (as per ImageGenerator) on dvi file
			- move resulting images to tmp/dvipng/whatever.png
			- remove tempdir
