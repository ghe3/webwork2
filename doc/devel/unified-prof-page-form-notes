specificity	global	user
	Indicates whether it is a global setting that is overridden for a user,
	or a user-only setting that is only overwritten for multiUser editing.
synonyms
	Regex-s indicating other values that could mean the same thing as the
	keys in the "items" hash.  This is for backwards compatibility with the
	days when even multi-choice fields were given freeform frontends.
	the special value "*" (an illegal regular expression) points to a value
	that should be substituted for unrecognized values.  The order that the
	values are checked against the regular expressions is unspecified, and
	probably won't be the order they are given in the source code.
